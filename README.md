Navigate your way through a deserted caving system and uncover the truth.

You will control Todd with each limb individually, using the mouse to fling yourself around with disregard for poor Todd's wellbeing.

Todd the Caver was created in 48 hours for Ludum Dare (compo) by me, Sam Bigos. It was created in the Godot game engine.
